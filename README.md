#  Bug Fixes Summary

This document lists the bugs found in different files (`main.py`, `agents.py`, `tools.py`, `task.py`) and the fixes applied.

---

##  `main.py`
- **Bug:** Importing all agents and tools directly → caused redundancy.  
   Fixed by only importing **specific agents and tools** actually used.

- **Bug:** Function `analyze()` was redefined (already present).  
   Removed duplicate definition and used the existing function.

---

##  `agents.py`
- **Bug:** `llm` was undefined inside agents.  
   Properly initialized the `GeminiWrapper` and passed `llm` to all agents.

- **Bug:** Inefficient / wrong prompts (unrealistic & non-deterministic).  
   Updated prompts with clear roles, goals, and backstory.

- **Bug:** Agents accepted unused tools.  
   Removed tools that were never invoked (kept only `FinancialDocumentTool` where needed).

---

##  `tools.py`
- **Bug:** Wrong import — `from crewai_tools.tools.pdf import Pdf` (module not found).  
   Fixed by switching to `from crewai_tools import PDFSearchTool`.

- **Bug:** `async` function usage without need.  
   Removed `async` since tools are static utilities.

- **Bug:** Missing `@staticmethod` in tool methods.  
   Added `@staticmethod` to ensure they don’t require a class instance.

- **Bug:** Risk/Investment tools double-cleaned text.  
   Simplified text preprocessing.

---

##  `task.py`
- **Bug:** Used placeholder `TODO` instead of real logic.  
   Implemented logic to assign agents → tasks → results pipeline.

- **Bug:** Agents not explicitly assigned to tasks.  
   Fixed by **binding tasks to specific agents**.

- **Bug:** Prompts were generic and repeated.  
   Changed prompts to **task-specific prompts** (analysis, verification, risk, recommendation).

---

##  Final Notes
- Removed all **unused imports & tools**.  
- Ensured **agents only use required tools**.  
- Made prompts and responses **deterministic** to reduce hallucinations.  
- Cleaned redundant code for maintainability.
